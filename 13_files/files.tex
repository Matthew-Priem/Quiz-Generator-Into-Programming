	% Problem 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item 
		Write 100 integers created randomly into a file named \textit{QuizInts.txt}. 
		The numbers should be between 50 and 200 (inclusively). 
		Each number should be on a new line.\\
		Hint: Your code will likely use the following two lines of code somewhere in your program.\\
			\tab import random.\\
			\tab random.randint(50,200)

	\item 
		Write a Python program that will open a file named \textit{thisFile.txt} and write every 
		other line into the file
		\textit{thatFile.txt}

	% Problem 3
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item
		Create a file named \textit{MyName.txt}, and write your name to it (your actual name).	 
		Then read the file and print the letters of your name one at a time where each letter is on a new line.

	% Problem 4
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%		
	\item
		Assume you are working on a file named \textit{MyCode.py} and there is a file \textit{MyWords.txt} in the same 
		working directory (same folder). The \textit{MyWords.txt} file contains exactly 20 words all written on separate
		lines. Read the file, and then write the words to a new file in four lines of five words.

	\item 
		A local middle school is trying to count the total number of lunches they served last year.  
		They have a text file named \textit{LunchData.txt} that has a date and the number of lunches served on that date.    
		There is one entry for every day last year.  A portion of that file is displayed below.  
		Write a program that calculates and then prints the total number of lunches served last year.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item 
		A city library keeps track of the number of visitors each day in a file named \textit{LibraryVisitsData.csv}.  
		The file contains a date and the number of visitors who entered the library on that date.  
		There is one entry for each day of the year. A portion of that file is shown below.  
		Write a program that reads the file, calculates, and prints the average number of visitors per day over the year.

	% Problem 9
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item 
		A school science fair recorded the daily number of students who visited each exhibit.  
		This information is stored in a file called \textit{ScienceFairVisitors.txt}, which includes a header row.  
		Each line contains the date and the number of visitors for that day.  
		Write a program that reads the file, and then prints the total number of visitors recorded over the entire period.

	% Problem 10
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item 
		A book club tracks how many pages each member read, stored in a file named 
		\textit{PagesRead.csv}. The file includes a header row and contains the member's 
		name and the number of pages they read for each book.  
		Write a program that reads the file, stores the data in a dictionary where the key is 
		the member name and the value is the total pages read by that member (across both books), 
		and then prints each member's name and their total pages read.
